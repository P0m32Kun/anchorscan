# Finish Work

Wrap up the current session: archive the active task and record the session journal on the still-open delivery PR. The reviewed work commit and PR URL exist before this command; commit/push the completion records to that same PR before merging it. Do not create a follow-up metadata PR for archive, journal, or `merged_at`.

## Step 1: Survey current state

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode record
```

This prints:

- **My active tasks** — review whether any besides the current one are actually done (code merged, AC met) and should be archived this round.
- **Git status** — quick visual on what's dirty.
- **Recent commits** — you'll need their hashes in Step 4 for `--commit`.

Archive the current active task when its complete gate passes. Leave other completed tasks that are not part of the current delivery untouched; their ownership is not inferred from this command.

## Step 2: Sanity check — classify dirty paths

Run:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Filter out paths under `.trellis/workspace/` and `.trellis/tasks/` — those are managed by `add_session.py` and `task.py archive` and can appear dirty as part of this skill's own work.

For each remaining dirty path, decide whether it belongs to **the current task** or to **other parallel work** (e.g., another terminal window editing the same repo). Heuristics:

- Paths referenced in the current task's `prd.md` / `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` → current task
- Paths in code areas matching the task's stated scope, or that you remember editing this session → current task
- Paths in unrelated areas you have no recollection of touching this session → other parallel work

Then route:

- **Any remaining path looks like current-task work** — bail out with:
  > "Working tree has uncommitted code changes from this task: `<list>`. Return to workflow Phase 3.4 to commit them before running ``finish-work` (Trellis command)`."

  Do NOT run `git commit` here. Do NOT prompt the user to commit. The user goes back to Phase 3.4 and the AI drives the batched commit there.
- **All remaining paths look unrelated** (other parallel-window work) — report them once and continue to Step 3:
  > "FYI, dirty files outside this task's scope — leaving them for the other window: `<list>`."
- **Genuinely unsure** — ask the user once: "Are `<list>` this task's work I forgot to commit, or another window's? (commit / ignore)" — then route per their answer.

## Step 3: Archive task(s)

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py archive <task-name>
```

At minimum: the current active task (if any). Archive state belongs in the current delivery PR; with `session_auto_commit: false`, create a normal archive commit and push it to that still-open PR.

If there is no active task and the user did not confirm any cleanup archives, skip this step.

## Step 4: Record session journal

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/add_session.py \
  --title "Session Title" \
  --commit "hash1,hash2" \
  --summary "Brief summary"
```

Use the work-commit hashes produced in Phase 3.4 (visible in Step 1's `Recent commits` list, or via `git log --oneline`) for `--commit`. Create the journal commit when needed and push it to the still-open delivery PR; do not create a separate PR after merge.

Under continuous authorization, archive/journal are routine and require no second confirmation. Escalate only unknown concurrent-work ownership, security/permission risk, product scope decisions, or Trellis upstream/global-install/npm-publication actions.
